# Yoga

A Fitness App.

## Getting Started

Sometimes we have lapses in our fitness seeking journey, some days, we end up drained and do not feel motivated
to work out, sometimes, we lack quick access to information we seek on healthy living. 

With the aid of this project, fitness seekers have a way to continue their journey, while having fun and tracking
their progress at the same time. 

Missed a few days? and want to know just how long you've been away?.

Want to work out? but your internet seems unstable?.

This App has got you covered.


**SOFTWARE USED FOR THE PROPOSED APP:**

- Android Studio
- Figma
- Flutter
- Rive

*ANDROID STUDIO*

Google's Android operating system Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is based on IntelliJ 
IDEA software from JetBrains and is especially designed for Android programming. It may be downloaded 
for operating systems based on Windows, macOS and Linux. It offers a unique environment for all Android 
devices to create. Apply Code and resource changes without rebooting to your running program.

*FIGMA*

Figma which is a web-based program for altering visuals and designing the user interface may be used to 
create mobile app interfaces, prototype designs, the production of social media postings, and anything else 
between all wireframe websites. Figma provides all the tools required for the project's design phase, 
including vector tools capable of full-fledged drawing, prototype capabilities, and code production for 
hand-off.

*FLUTTER*

This is a software development kit (SDK) containing pre-written code that includes ready-to-use and 
configurable widgets, as well as libraries, tools, and documentation for building cross-platform programs.

*RIVE*

Rive is a design tool that allows you to design and animate, also allows you to create real assets that are
ready to be implemented in the final product

# APP FLOW

From the Splash Screen, user lands on the home screen which has a bottom navigation bar, with the home button
right in the middle of it. 

**THE HOME SCREEN** enables user to choose from pre-arranged work-out routines. 
When a routine is selected, user is taken to the countdown screen that counts user down in 5 seconds then
sends them to the workout proper. User goes through several poses. Each pose lasts 30 seconds and for each
pose there is a 20 seconds break. 

At the end of every workout session, user is taken to the **FINISH SCREEN** where thy can see how much 
calories they have burned and how long they spent for the session.

If user had skipped most of the poses and found themselves at the last workout, the app is smart enough to know,
and it shows you a different finish screen than people who have scrupulously gone through the routine.

**TODAY SCREEN** gives user access to their daily achievements, and their overall streak. It also lets them know what
routines they completed and offers suggestions for ones they haven't completed yet.

**SETTINGS SCREEN** where user can customize their User Interface to further enhance their experience. This application
is User Experience driven because the user needs to be in their best state of mind to achieve their best 
yoga experience and the feel of the application or the environment in which they find themselves will play
a huge role. Putting the customization of the User Interface in the hands of the user will give them the 
ability to set their comfort level:

- *Theme*

which covers everything from the brightness mode of their device to the appearance of widgets and font of 
texts that appear on their screen.

The user can also find the app information in the settings page, where they can read the bio of the app
and view the application's licences.
